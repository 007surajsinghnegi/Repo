  <div class="grid-container" style="    padding: 55px">
    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>India ranks among the best in the world in terms of medical value travel across the globe. India has best
      hospitals, renowned doctors, state-of-the-art infrastructure, traditional hospitality and the best
      economical surgery packages. According to the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), the primary reason
      that attracts medical value travel to India is cost-effectiveness and treatment from accredited facilities
      at par with developed countries at much lower cost.</p>
    <p> India Treatment Help is dedicated to improve & empower
      health of people and changing lives of patient by providing them quality healthcare services at cost
      effective prices. We assist patient to find diagnostic & therapeutic treatment in India.<br> The company is
      associated with intellectual & renowned doctors across the country to assist patient in choosing appropriate
      treatment at cost effective prices. Our focus is on technological advance treatment with value added
      services to patients.</p>
    <p> India Treatment Help is key to affordable and accessible healthcare services as most
      of people have to bear healthcare expenses as ‘’ out of pocket’’ expenses. With experience of more than 10
      years in serving and helping patients<br> we are working on beginning to end help model for providing help,
      guidance & support in finding correct diagnosis and right treatment plan for the patient with no extra cost.
      We are associated with multiple hospitals for over a decade now and have been serving patients by working as
      a bridge between the patient and healthcare provider.</p>
    <p>Selection of right doctor and right hospital is also
      an important decision which patient<br> decides before initiating treatment. We help patient in selecting
      the
      right doctor for their treatment by discussing the reports with experience and renowned doctors and
      hospital.</p>
    <p>Since patients have multiple queries in beginning of the treatment and hospitals are not able to
      provide personal touch to every query. We bridge patient and doctor to give valuable time to resolve medical
      queries of the patients who are not in India as we coordinate with the hospitals directly on patient behalf
      with no extra cost.</p>
